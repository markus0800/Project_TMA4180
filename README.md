In this project we have studied an optimisation based model for the problem of form-finding of tensegrity
structures. First we proved the existence of solutions for different constraints. Furthermore we proved
convexity for cable nets and non-convexity from tensegrity domes. We later show that the optimisation
problem is part of C1, but not in C2. We formulated the necessary and sufficient optimality conditions.
Lastly we implemented a Quasi-Newton algorithm for solving the optimisation problem numerically
